      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

The following npm package may be included in this product:

 - html-parse-stringify@3.0.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# html-parse-stringify

This is an _experimental lightweight approach_ to enable quickly parsing HTML into an AST and stringify'ing it back to the original string.

As it turns out, if you can make a the simplifying assumptions about HTML that all tags must be closed or self-closing. Which is OK for _this_ particular application. You can write a super light/fast parser in JS with regex.

"Why on earth would you do this?! Haven't you read: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1732348/regex-match-open-tags-except-xhtml-self-contained-tags ?!?!"

Why yes, yes I have :)

But the truth is. If you _could_ do this in a whopping grand total of ~600 bytes (min+gzip) as this repo shows. It potentially enables DOM diffing based on a HTML strings to be super light and fast in a browser. What is that you say? DOM-diffing?

Yes.

React.js essentially pioneered the approach. With React you render to a "virtual DOM" whenever you want to, and the virtual DOM can then diff against the real DOM (or the last virtual DOM) and then turn that diff into whatever transformations are necessary to get the _real_ DOM to match what you rendered as efficiently as possible.

As a result, when you're building a single page app, you don't have to worry so much about bindings. Instead, you simple re-render to the virtual DOM whenever you know something's changed. All of a sudden being able to have `change` events for individual properties becomes less important, instead you can just reference those values in your template whenever you think something changed.

Cool idea, right?!

## So why this?

Well, there are other things React expects me to do if I use it that I don't like. Such as the custom templating and syntax you have to use.

If, hypothetically, you could instead diff an HTML string (generated by _whatever_ templating language of your choice) against the DOM, then you'd get the same benefit, sans React's impositions.

This may all turn out to be a bad idea altogether, but initial results seem promising when paired with [virtual-dom](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom).

But you can't just diff HTML strings, as simple strings, very easily, in order to diff two HTML node trees you have to first turn that string into a tree structure of some sort. Typically, the thing you generate from parsing something like this is called an AST (abstract syntax tree).

This lib does exactly that.

It has two methods:

1. parse
2. stringify

## `.parse(htmlString, options)`

Takes a string of HTML and turns it into an AST, the only option you can currently pass is an object of registered `components` whose children will be ignored when generating the AST.

## `.stringify(AST)`

Takes an AST and turns it back into a string of HTML.

## What does the AST look like?

See comments in the following example:

```js
var HTML = require('html-parse-stringify')

// this html:
var html = '<div class="oh"><p>hi</p></div>'

// becomes this AST:
var ast = HTML.parse(html)

console.log(ast)
/*
{
    // can be `tag`, `text` or `component`
    type: 'tag',

    // name of tag if relevant
    name: 'div',
    
    // parsed attribute object
    attrs: {
        class: 'oh'
    },

    // whether this is a self-closing tag
    // such as <img/>
    voidElement: false,

    // an array of child nodes
    // we see the same structure
    // repeated in each of these
    children: [
        {
            type: 'tag',
            name: 'p',
            attrs: {},
            voidElement: false,
            children: [
                // this is a text node
                // it also has a `type`
                // but nothing other than
                // a `content` containing
                // its text.
                {
                    type: 'text',

## the AST node types

### 1. tag

properties:

- `type` - will always be `tag` for this type of node
- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
- `children` - array of child nodes. Note that any continuous string of text is a text node child, see below.

### 2. text

properties:

- `type` - will always be `text` for this type of node
- `content` - text content of the node

### 3. component

If you pass an object of `components` as part of the `options` object passed as the second argument to `.parse()` then the AST won't keep parsing that branch of the DOM tree when it one of those registered components.

This is so that it's possible to ignore sections of the tree that you may want to handle by another "subview" in your application that handles it's own DOM diffing.

properties:

- `type` - will always be `component` for this type of node
- `name` - tag name, such as 'div'
- `attrs` - an object of key/value pairs. If an attribute has multiple space-separated items such as classes, they'll still be in a single string, for example: `class: "class1 class2"`
- `voidElement` - `true` or `false`. Whether this tag is a known void element as defined by [spec](http://www.w3.org/html/wg/drafts/html/master/syntax.html#void-elements).
- `children` - it will still have a `children` array, but it will always be empty.

## changelog

- `3.0.1` Merged #47 which makes void elements check case insensitive. Thanks again, [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!
- `3.0.0` Merged #46 which fixed an issue with handling of whitespace. Doing major version bump since this changes behavior if you have whitespace only nodes (see merged PR and #45 for more details). Thanks [@adrai](https://github.com/adrai) for this contribution!
- `2.1.1` Merged #41 which fixed an issue with tag nesting. Thanks [@ericponto](https://github.com/ericponto).
- `2.1.0` Merged support for numeric tags. This allows a use case described in [this PR](https://github.com/HenrikJoreteg/html-parse-stringify/pull/43). Thanks [@kachkaev](https://github.com/kachkaev).
- `2.0.3` Fixed failed publish. Accidentally published an empty package :sweat_smile:
- `2.0.2` Fixed incorrect attribution for vulnerability disclosure. The vulnerability was discovered by Yeting Li. Sam Sanoop was the one who reached out to me about it.
- `2.0.1` Addressing a reported regular expression denial of service issue found by [Yeting Li](https://github.com/yetingli) and reported to me by [Sam Sanoop](https://twitter.com/snoopysecurity) of [Snyk](https://snyk.io/) THANK YOU!. The issue was that sending certain input would cause one of the regular expressions we used to lock up and not finish, freezing the process. See the test that was added for details. To be clear, this lib wasn't meant for parsing non-well formed HTML. But, better safe than sorry! So we're fixing it.
- `2.0.0` updated to more modern dependencies/build system. Switched to prettier, etc. No big feature differences, just new build system/project structure. Added support for top level text nodes thanks to @jperl. Added support for comments thanks to @pconerly.
- `1.0.0 - 1.0.3` no big changes, bug fixes and speed improvements.

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# Theming

[![Dependency Status][depstat-image]][depstat-url]

## Unified CSSinJS theming solution for React

* `ThemeProvider` allows you to pass, update, merge and augment `theme` through context down react tree.
* `withTheme` allows you to receive theme and its updates in your components as a `theme` prop.
* `createTheming` allows you to integrate `theming` into your CSSinJS library with custom `channel` (if you need custom one).

See [Motivation](#motivation) for details.

  * [ThemeProvider](#themeprovider)
  * [withTheme](#withthemecomponent)
  * [useTheme](#usetheme)
  * [createTheming](#createthemingcustomchannel)
* [Credits](#credits)
* [License](#license)


## Install

    npm install --save theming
    # or
    yarn add theming


## Usage

In your components

Note: this component is used to show what theme you receive.

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { withTheme } from 'theming';

const DemoBox = props => {
  console.log(props.theme);
  return (<div />);
}

export default withTheme(DemoBox);
```

In your app

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theming';
import DemoBox from './components/DemoBox'

const theme = {
  color: 'black',
  background: 'white',
};

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <DemoBox /> {/* { color: 'black', background: 'white' } */}
  </ThemeProvider>
)

export default App;
```

## Playground demo

Be our guest, play with `theming` in codesandbox:
[https://codesandbox.io/s/jvwzkkxrp5](https://codesandbox.io/s/jvwzkkxrp5)

![theming playground demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/559321/27082371-ba194816-5044-11e7-8f06-6cbdbdefb602.gif)

## Motivation

These components are enabling seamless theming for your react applications. So as far as you don't want to pass the theme object to every component. That's why you want to use context. However, as far context feature is _experimental API and it is likely to break in future releases of React_ you don't want to use it directly. Here `theming` comes to play.

> If you insist on using context despite these warnings, try to isolate your use of context to a small area and avoid using the context API directly when possible so that it's easier to upgrade when the API changes.

Regarding _isolation your use of context to a small area_ and _small areas__ in particular our very own react prophet Dan Abramov have a thing to say:

> Should I use React unstable “context” feature?

So you are okay to use context for theming. `theming` package provides everything you need to do that:
* The `ThemeProvider` allows you to pass and update your theme through context down the react tree.
* `withTheme` allows you to receive theme and its updates in your components as a `theme` prop.
* `createTheming` allows you to integrate `theming` into your CSSinJS library with a custom `context` (if you need custom one).


## API

### ThemeProvider

React High-Order component, which passes theme object down the react tree by context.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theming';
const theme = { /*…*/ };

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <App />
</ThemeProvider>
```

#### props

##### props.theme

*Required*
Type: `Object`, `Function`

If its `Object` and its root `ThemeProvider` then it's intact and being passed down the react tree.

```jsx
const theme = { themed: true };

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <DemoBox /> {/* { themed: true } */}
</ThemeProvider>
```

If its `Object` and its nested `ThemeProvider` then it is being merged with the theme from the parent `ThemeProvider` and passed down to the react tree.

```jsx
const theme = { themed: true };
const patch = { merged: true };

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <ThemeProvider theme={patch}>
    <DemoBox /> {/* { themed: true, merged: true } */}
  </ThemeProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

If its `Function` and its nested `ThemeProvider` then it's being applied to the theme from parent `ThemeProvider`. If the result is an `Object` it's passed down to the react tree, throws otherwise.

```jsx
const theme = { themed: true };
const augment = outerTheme =>
  Object.assign({}, outerTheme, { augmented: true });

<ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
  <ThemeProvider theme={augment}>
    <DemoBox /> {/* { themed: true, augmented: true } */}
  </ThemeProvider>
</ThemeProvider>
```

##### props.children

*Required*
Type: `PropTypes.element`

### withTheme(component)

React High-Order component, which maps context to theme prop.

#### component

*Required*
Type: `ComponentType`

You need to have `ThemeProvider` with a theme somewhere upper the react tree after that wrap your component in `withTheme` and your component gets the theme as a prop. `withTheme`  handles the initial theme object as well as theme updates.

PS. It doesn't break if you have `PureComponent` somewhere in between your `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme`.

Usage with Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { withTheme } from 'theming';

const DemoBox = props => {
  console.log(props.theme);
  return (<div />);
}

export default withTheme(DemoBox);
```

In the app:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { ThemeProvider } from 'theming';
import DemoBox from './components/DemoBox'

const theme = {
  color: 'black',
  background: 'white',
};

const App = () => (
  <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
    <DemoBox /> {/* { color: 'black', background: 'white' } */}
  </ThemeProvider>
)

export default App;
```

#### Access inner component instance

The `withTheme` HOC supports the new React forwardRef API so you can use the regular ref prop.

### useTheme

When you are on React 16.8 higher you will be able to use the `useTheme` hook which will return the theme object.

Usage with Component:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useTheme } from 'theming';

const DemoBox = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  console.log(theme);
  return (<div />);
}

export default Demobox;
```

### createTheming(context)

Function to create `ThemeProvider` and `withTheme` with custom context.
The context you pass in is used.

#### context

Type: `Object`
Result: `Object { withTheme, ThemeProvider, useTheme }`

`withTheme`, `ThemeProvider` and `useTheme` will use the context passed to `createTheming`.

Note: You will only be able to use `useTheme` when you are on React version 16.8 or higher.

```js
import { createTheming } from 'theming';
import React from 'react';

const context = React.createContext({});
const theming = createTheming(context);

const { withTheme, ThemeProvider, useTheme } = theming;

export default {
  withTheme,
  ThemeProvider,
  useTheme,
};
```

## ThemeContext

We export the default ThemeContext so you can use it with the new `static contextType` with classes or even the new React Hooks API.
This is the context which also the exported `withTheme` and `ThemeProvider` use.

```js
import { ThemeContext } from 'theming';
```
